                Hi! My name is Greg Olson and I am just starting the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp! This is a
                basic portfolio site
                where I am learning HTML and CSS. (There's a lot to it!)
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in Salt Lake City and I moved here to have a base camp for rock climbing. I don't have too much
                time to climb
                any more because I have a 2 1/2 year old son named Baker, I am also attending the Bootcamp, and I work
                full time
                managing a fine dining restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
                My son loves to go hiking, so that is our main outdoor activity right now. I've been trying to get him
                to ski, but
                he really doesn't like ski boots (who does?). He is into Dinosaurs, Mermaids, Penguins, and Orca
                whales. He loves to
                go to the Loveland Living Planet Aquarium in Draper.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see some of my previous design school projects along with some of my current code projects in the Portfolio
                section. Feel free to send me a message with the
                contact form.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for checking out my site!
            </p>
